# About this training

A training workshop by [Mediacurrent](https://mediacurrent.com).

## Getting Started

This repo will allow you to get the codebase to build a new Gatsby website which has been configured to pull its content from Drupal running at Pantheon.

### Requirements

* NVM
* NodeJS & NPM

**Instructions for installing NVM, Node & NPM on** [macOS](https://medium.com/@jamesauble/install-nvm-on-mac-with-brew-adb921fb92cc) or [Windows](https://codeburst.io/nvm-for-windows-how-to-install-and-use-13b7a4209791).

## 1. Clone this repo anywhere in you local system

You can clone or download the repo anywhere in your computer \(i.e. Sites, Downloads, Documents, Desktop, etc.\). To clone the repo, run this command:

```text
git clone git@github.com:mediacurrent/gatsby-training.git
```

## 2. Build the environment:

This setup includes Drupal and Gatsby, but for the purpose of this training you only need to run Gatsby since we will be running Drupal from Pantheon.

After cloning the repo, cd into the newly created diectory:

```text
cd gatsby-training/gatsby
```

**NOTE**: _This is the default directory generated by cloning the repo. If you changed the directory name when cloning the repo, cd into that directory instead_.

```text
npm install
```

_If you get errors, you can try running:_ `nvm install` then `nvm use`.

```text
npm start
```

_This will start Gatsby which should immediately connect to Drupal to pull all content_.
