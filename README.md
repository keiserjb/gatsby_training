# Welcome Gatsby Training
A training workshop by [Mediacurrent](https://mediacurrent.com).

## Getting Started
This repo includes everything you need to set up a [Lando-based](https://docs.devwithlando.io/) environment.  Lando is a free, open source, cross-platform, local development environment tool built on Docker container technology.

### Prerequisites
* Lando and Docker
* macOS 10.13 or later \(May need to install command line tools\)
* Windows 10 Pro+ \(or equivalent\) with Hyper-V running
* Linux \(with kernel version 4.x or higher\)

[See the full requirements](https://docs.lando.dev/basics/installation.html#system-requirements).


## 1. Install Lando and Docker

Follow the instructions below to setup your local dev environment.

* [Install Lando and Docker](https://github.com/lando/lando/releases) (Select latest version)


## 2. Clone this repo anywhere in you local system
You can clone or download the repo anywhere in your computer (i.e. Sites, Downloads, Documents, Desktop, etc.).  To clone the repo, run this command:

```
git clone git@github.com:mediacurrent/gatsby-training.git
```

## 3. Build the environment:
This setup includes Drupal and Gatsby, but for the purpose of this training you only need to run Gatsby since we will be running Drupal from Pantheon.

**WINDOWS USERS:**  Use Power Shell to run all commands.

1. After cloning the repo, cd into the newly created diectory:
```
cd gatsby-training
```
**NOTE**: _This is the default directory generated by cloning the repo.  If you changed the directory name when cloning the repo, cd into that directory instead_.


```
lando start
```
_This will set up the Docker containers needed by Gatsby_.

```
cd gatsby
```
```
lando npm start
```
_This will start Gatsby which should immediately connect to Drupal to pull all content_.
