# Movie Card

So by now you should have a pretty good idea on how to build simple components and make them available so they can be reused throughout a website.  Now let's build a more complex component in which we will reuse previously built components.  The Card component is widely used to display individual movies as well as the large Featured Movie at the top of the homepage and in individual pages.

In this component we will reused the Eyebrow, Button and other small components to build a larger component.  This is the Atomic Design approach where you first build Atoms and then build Molecules, Organisms, etc.  The Card component is a Molecule because it combines multiple Atoms.
